### What is MicroMouse ? ###

[MicroMouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse) is an autonomous, timed, maze solving competition. To win the robot must (without intervention) find the center of a maze and make the fastest run from start to center within a fixed time limit. (More rules [here](http://sites.ieee.org/r1/files/2013/03/2013-Region-1-Micromouse-Competition-Rules.pdf).)
